# Garment Worker Productivity Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict the productivity of garment workers based on a variety of factory-related attributes. An XGBoost Regressor model is trained and optimized to understand the key factors that influence worker productivity.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the **Garments Worker Productivity Dataset**, which contains 15 different attributes for 1197 instances.

**Features:**

  - `date`: Date of the observation.
  - `quarter`: The quarter of the year (Quarter1, Quarter2, etc.).
  - `department`: The department in the factory (sewing, finishing).
  - `day`: Day of the week.
  - `team`: The team number of the workers.
  - `targeted_productivity`: The productivity target set for the team.
  - `smv`: Standard Minute Value, the time allocated for a task.
  - `wip`: Work in progress, number of unfinished items.
  - `over_time`: Amount of overtime worked in minutes.
  - `incentive`: Financial incentive offered.
  - `idle_time`: Amount of time the production was interrupted.
  - `idle_men`: Number of workers who were idle.
  - `no_of_style_change`: Number of changes in the product style.
  - `no_of_workers`: Number of workers in the team.
  - `actual_productivity`: The target variable; the actual productivity achieved.

## Project Workflow

1.  **Data Loading & Cleaning**: The dataset is loaded, and initial data inspection is performed. Missing values in the `wip` column are filled using the median.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations such as count plots, histograms, and scatter plots are used to understand data distributions and relationships between variables. A correlation heatmap is generated to identify multicollinearity.
3.  **Data Preprocessing**: Outliers in key numerical columns are identified using the IQR method and removed. Categorical features (`day`, `quarter`, `department`) are converted into numerical format. Continuous numerical features are scaled using `StandardScaler`.
4.  **Model Training**: An **XGBoost Regressor** is chosen for the prediction task.
5.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: `RandomizedSearchCV` is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for the XGBoost model, tuning for `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `max_depth`, and more.
6.  **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R²). The evaluation is done on a test set and reinforced with 5-fold cross-validation.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA revealed several key insights:

  * The distributions for `actual_productivity` and `targeted_productivity` are slightly skewed.
  * A strong positive correlation exists between `targeted_productivity` and `actual_productivity`.
  * `smv` (Standard Minute Value) and `no_of_workers` also show a moderate positive correlation with `actual_productivity`.

-----

## Model Training and Evaluation

An XGBoost Regressor was trained on the preprocessed data. `RandomizedSearchCV` determined the best hyperparameters to be:

  * **subsample**: 0.9
  * **n\_estimators**: 100
  * **max\_depth**: 6
  * **learning\_rate**: 0.1
  * **colsample\_bytree**: 0.5

The model was then evaluated on the hold-out test set and through 5-fold cross-validation.

-----

## Results

### Model Performance

The final model's performance, validated using 5-fold cross-validation, is as follows:

  * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 0.0860 (± 0.0138)
  * **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 0.1334 (± 0.0167)
  * **R-squared (R²)**: 0.3859 (± 0.0404)

The **R-squared value of approximately 0.39** indicates that the model can explain about 39% of the variance in actual worker productivity, suggesting a moderate predictive capability.

### Feature Importance

The feature importance plot shows that `smv`, `targeted_productivity`, and `no_of_workers` are the most influential factors in predicting worker productivity.

### Learning Curve

The learning curve shows that the training error and validation error converge as the training set size increases. This indicates that the model does not suffer from high variance (overfitting). However, the errors converge at a value higher than zero, suggesting there may be some underlying bias, and adding more data of the same type might not significantly improve the model's performance.

## Conclusion

This project successfully developed an XGBoost Regressor to predict garment worker productivity. The model demonstrates moderate predictive power, with key drivers of productivity identified as the standard time allocated for a task (`smv`), the initial productivity target, and the number of workers.

Future improvements could include:

  * Engineering new features from the existing data (e.g., from the `date` column).
  * Experimenting with other regression algorithms like LightGBM or a deep learning approach.
  * Collecting more diverse data to help the model generalize better and reduce bias.
